# networks

For this group project we had to create our own consensus algorithm and implement it.
Collaboration with other groups was essentail in order to have mutiple clients connected a the same time.
A riddle was also fabricated to add extra security for users.

Instructions for running the code:
- download client.py and server.py
- run server.py using command python3 server.py in terminal
- make sure client file contains the correct ip address and port number for the devie running the server
- run client.py using python3 client.py
